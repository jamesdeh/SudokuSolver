Just a quick project I did over a few sessions. I originally created an algorithm to solve the sudoku board I supplied and then expanded on the program to create its own sudoku board and then solve it.

Future Improvements:

GUI: GUI to pick difficulty and display initial and solved sudoku in a user-friendly way
Improve Algorithm: Improve algorithms as it is a slow way of solving the issue (Maybe looking at threads?)
