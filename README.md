Just a quick project I did over a few sessions. I orinally created an algorithim to solve the sudoku board I supplied and then expanded on the program to create its own sudoku board and then solve it.

Future Improvements:

GUI: GUI to pick difficulty and display initial and solved sudoku in a user friendly way
Improve Algorithim: Improve algorithim as it is a slow way of solving the issue (Maybe looking at threads?)
